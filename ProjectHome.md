# What is Toread? #
Toread is an open source Network Coordinates(NC) project written by Python. This project is collaborated by Tsinghua University (China) and University of Goettingen (Germany). Toread is a fully decentralized NC middleware which is compatible for several popular distributed NC algorithms. Many distributed applications can be benefit from this, including P2P and DHT etc. Till now, we have implemented two NC algorithms named **Vivaldi** and **[Pharos](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ychen/Project_Pharos.html)**. We are implementing **[Phoenix](http://www.cs.duke.edu/~ychen/Project_Phoenix.html)** now.
